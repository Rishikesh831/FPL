# Freelance Proposal Lab (FPL)

Freelance Proposal Lab (FPL) is a web application that helps freelancers and small agencies generate professional, client-ready project proposals in minutes.

## üöÄ Overview

Writing custom proposals for every client takes time and effort. FPL simplifies this process by allowing users to:
- Paste a job description or client brief
- Enter key details like hourly rate and estimated hours
- Instantly generate a personalized proposal preview using smart templates
- Save drafts locally (first version)
- Export or copy the final proposal for client use

Future versions will include AI-assisted proposal generation, price estimation, authentication, and billing features.

## üß† Vision

Our goal is to save freelancers hours of repetitive writing and pricing work ‚Äî converting that time directly into billable hours or better client communication.  
FPL will evolve into a productivity platform for freelancers and agencies, integrating:
- AI-based proposal text generation
- Automated price estimation using ML
- Client/project analytics
- Subscription and pay-per-use monetization
